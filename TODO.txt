TODO

+ Work out why the grid shifts down when redrawn
+ Work out why the cells resize when the button moves down
+ Get the width of the grid from the view system
+ Set the width of the grid and the height of the numbers independently
+ New approach:
	+ Relative bounds defines the size of items compared to the original full screen size
	+ If the total relative bounds exceeds 100% of the boundary then we increase the absolute size of the rendered canvas
	+ Background/binding renderer is *special* as it takes the total relative size of the grid and then adjusts it's absolute height
+ Why does the font not change when the game gets smaller
+ Make the resize grid button resize properly
+ Make the cursor view resize properly
+ Make the background view draw lower when the bounds are expanded
+ Make the bindings render as expected
+ Scrolling
	+ Implement stop scrolling beyond the bottom of the resize button
	+ Allow scrolling using the mouse wheel
